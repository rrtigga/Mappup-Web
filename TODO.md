-Make Map Responsive 

-Resize InfoBubble on smaller devices

-Figure out how to scrape all facebook events by city

-Continuously load events into database (this needs to be automated somehow)

-Load only events that are happening now to 2 days later

-Improve Design of Product

-Figure out what you're trying to achieve with the web version and why you're building it

Just focus on making a useful project first then focus on responsiveness
